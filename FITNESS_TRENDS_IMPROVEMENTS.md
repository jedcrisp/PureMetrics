# Fitness Trends Improvements

## ✅ **Fixed Issues**

### **1. BP Trend Visibility**
- **Before**: BP trend chart showed even when fitness was selected
- **After**: BP trend chart only shows for BP-related metrics (Systolic, Diastolic, Heart Rate)
- **Result**: Cleaner interface, no irrelevant data when viewing fitness trends

### **2. Smart Exercise Selection**
- **Before**: Showed all exercise types, even ones with no data
- **After**: Only shows exercises that have actual data in the selected time range
- **Result**: No more empty exercise options, only relevant choices

## ✅ **New Features**

### **1. Dynamic Exercise List**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🏋️ Exercise Type        (3 exercises)  │
│ [Bench Press ▼]                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
- Shows count of available exercises
- Only displays exercises with data
- Automatically sorts alphabetically

### **2. Smart Auto-Selection**
- When switching time ranges, automatically selects first available exercise
- If current exercise has no data, switches to one that does
- Prevents "no data" states when other exercises have data

### **3. Better Empty States**
- **No exercises at all**: "Start tracking your workouts to see progress over time."
- **No data for selected exercise**: "No bench press data in the selected time range. Try a different exercise or time period."

### **4. Time Range Awareness**
- Exercise list updates based on selected time range
- Week view: Only shows exercises from last week
- Month view: Only shows exercises from last month
- etc.

## ✅ **User Experience**

### **Before**
1. Select "Fitness" metric
2. See BP chart (confusing!)
3. Scroll through 10+ exercise types
4. Most have no data
5. Get "no data" message for most exercises

### **After**
1. Select "Fitness" metric
2. See only fitness-related content
3. See only 2-3 exercises that actually have data
4. Automatically selects an exercise with data
5. Clear guidance if no data exists

## ✅ **Technical Implementation**

- `availableExercises`: Computed property that filters exercises by time range and data availability
- `onChange(of: availableExercises)`: Automatically updates selection when list changes
- Conditional BP chart display: Only shows for non-fitness metrics
- Smart empty state messages based on data availability

The fitness trends are now much more user-friendly and only show relevant data!
